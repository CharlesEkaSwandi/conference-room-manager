This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

# Architecture Decisions

## Core Framework & Runtime

- **Next.js 15.1.6** - Chosen for server-side rendering capabilities, built-in routing, and optimized performance features
- **React 19.0.0** - Main UI library for component-based development
- **TypeScript** - For type safety and improved developer experience

## Backend & Data Layer

- **Firebase 11.3.0** - Selected as the backend solution for:
  - Real-time database capabilities
  - Built-in authentication
  - Scalable hosting
  - Easy integration with frontend

## UI & Styling

- **Ant Design 5.23.4** - Enterprise-grade UI component library providing:

  - Comprehensive component ecosystem
  - Built-in design system
  - Accessibility features
- **Tailwind CSS 3.4.17** - Utility-first CSS framework for:

  - Rapid UI development
  - Consistent styling
  - Reduced CSS bundle size through purging

## Development Environment

- **Turbopack** - Next.js bundler for improved development experience
- **ESLint** - Maintaining code quality and consistency
- **PostCSS** - For modern CSS processing and transformations

## Project Structure

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
